Biography
======
Hi, my name is Zhu(Ellen) Wang. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Northwestern University. I earned my Ph.D in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I used to work at [ADVIS Lab](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ifc/advis.html), advised by Prof. [Isabel Cruz](https://www.cs.uic.edu/Cruz/)(In Memoriam). Currently, I am advised by Prof. [Saythi Ravi](https://sathya-uic.github.io/), and work on multimodal analysis of vision and language models.

My research interests are primarily in Deep Learning models and Graph Mining. Particularly, I am working on their **interdisciplinary** field therein to solve multimodal problems, especially on vision and language related tasks, such as VQA, visual reasoning and open-vocabulary object detection. My future research directions mainly focus on applying AI technologies for science, such as biology, pyschology and social science.
