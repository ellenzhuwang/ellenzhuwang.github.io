Hi, I’m Zhu (Ellen) Wang. I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Northwestern University, working with Prof. [Brian Uzzi](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/htm/index.htm). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago. During my doctoral studies, I was affiliated with the [ADVIS Lab](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ifc/advis.html) and was advised by Prof. [Isabel Cruz](https://www.cs.uic.edu/Cruz/) (In Memoriam). I later worked with Prof. [Saythi Ravi](https://sathya-uic.github.io/) on multimodal vision–language models.

My research lies at the intersection of deep learning and network science. I study multimodal AI systems that integrate vision, language, and structured knowledge to support robust reasoning across domains. My work spans vision–language modeling, optimization, and applications of scientific and technological systems.

More broadly, I focus on **AI for scientific discovery** — developing systems that model and reason over complex knowledge structures in science.
